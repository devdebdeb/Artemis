League of Legends Project that started as College Semester Project - In development

For the College Project we wanted to use Regression methods to prove or disprove the existence of big classes of Junglers in League of Legends, that led us to a conclusion that league is a complex game that needs to be studies, where a lot of different things can impact, and while there is evidence of the big classes they also seem to be lacking for more complex champions or champions that have special gimmicks like Kindred, Ivern and Karthus

The contributors for this part of the project where
César Sibila (Me)
André Messina Livingston

As for the future development of the Project me and André will continue changing the vision of the project and getting more exciting functions and uses for the data we collect!
